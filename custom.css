This is the file where you should make any CSS customizations (i.e. in the form
of additions). No changes should be made to the original styles.css file,
otherwise you'll have a lot of work to do when you update!

This file is also loaded after styles.css, so you don't need to worry. You can
replace any defaults like this. Be sure to also transfer this file when you
update.
